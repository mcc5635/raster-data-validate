## 1. Data Download Instructions
- **Tool**: `gsutil`
- **Download from public Google Cloud Storage bucket with the following commands using the `gsutil` tool**:
  ```bash
  mkdir geospatial/
  gsutil -m cp -R gs://geospatial-space/* geospatial/
  ```
- **Once Downloaded, Expected Folder Structure**:
  ```
  geospatial/
    ├── rasters/
    │   ├── XXX_YYY_ZZ.tif
    │ 
    └── tiff1212.geojson (vector file)
  ```

## 2. Data Requirements

`Raster Files`
`../rasters/XXX_YYY_ZZ.tif`
- File Format:
    - Rasters are stored in GeoTIFF format (metadata of .tif).
- Source Imagery:
    - The rasters are derived from Landsat imagery.
- Spatial Resolution:
    - The spatial resolution of the raster data is 30 meters `(30.0, 30.0) or 30m x 30m` (a tuple)
- Temporal Coverage:
    - Yearly images have been stacked from 1984 to 2020.
    - Each year’s image contains 6 bands of data (a raster band is analogous to an image channel).
- Total Bands:
    - The result is (37 years * 6 bands per year) = 222 total bands per raster file.
- Dimensions:
    - Each raster has dimensions of 984x1305 pixels.
    - The resulting numpy array for the file has the shape `[222, 984, 1305]`.
- Coordinate Reference System (CRS):
    - The coordinate reference system (CRS) for the rasters is WGS84 (default for AWS and Landsat).

`Coordinates`
`../coordinates.geojson`
- The coordinate data is stored as a shapely `MultiPoint` geometry in a GeoJSON file.
- Each coordinate represents a (longitude, latitude) pair.
- You may assume that each coordinate listed exists in one of the raster files.

## 3. Task
The goal of the assignment is to efficiently index into the provided rasters and extract "chips". A chip is defined as a square of pixels centered around a coordinate for a given year.

## 4. Ideas for Extensions
- Create a completely vectorized version of this approach with numpy.
- Use a machine learning library such as PyTorch or TensorFlow to create a dataloader for this dataset, where a labeled example is a tuple consisting of a chip and the shapely geometry for its center coordinate.
- Use `mmap` and/or caching to extract chips from a data stream.

## 5. Questions
Informally describe the runtime and memory complexities of your solution as a function of:
- The number of raster (.tif) files
- The number of coordinates
- How would an ideal implementation change if you had to process 100x the number of rasters and/or coordinates?
